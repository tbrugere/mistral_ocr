# Basic CLI for Mistral OCR

I needed to read some pdfs on my phone, but they didn't have text metadata, and were not written for such a small screen. So I wrote this quick CLI tool to extract the text into markdown files using MistralAI's OCR models.

## Installation

using uv

```bash
uv tool install git+https://github.com/tbrugere/mistral_ocr
```
